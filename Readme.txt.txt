Netflix Project

In this project, I tried to Analyze the data and generate insights that could help Netflix ijn deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries.
Conducted statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Numpy and Pandas, performed data visualization by creating visual charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Insights drawn from the data include the most popular actor, the popularity of genres, and the distribution of content creation by country.
